- preceding dropdowns should be selected for the succeeding to be activated(displayed)
- figure out features and pricing tabs and weather they're necessary
- professor also said there was an issue with device compatibility
- ADA compliant checker: https://www.webaccessibility.com/
- LocalStorage to store customizable frontend data
- Don't just read the PowerPoint slide; put keywords instead
- Remove “Welcome to xxx” —> useless content
- device compatibility --> "user-scalable=no" (because he manually zoomed in.)
- Don’t show anything for autocomplete dropdown until user starts to type something.
